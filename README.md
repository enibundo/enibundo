## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate technologist with particular interest in _decentralization_.

Throughout my professional career I have had the chance to work in amazing teams in domains like: financial derivatives pricing, trading, arbitrage, risk calculation and hedging, insurance pricing, wallet infrastructure development, financial fund tokenization (web3), dapp and smart contract development, etc. (my full cv is found here: http://www.bun.do/cvenibundoen.pdf)

In terms of stack nowadays I mostly do _typescript, node, react, nextJs, rust, solidity, terraform, aws_ and everything around _distributed systems_ and _microservices_.
I consider myself quite flexible in terms of tech stack and like to learn continously.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about COW protocol, MEV and flashbots
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on blockchain implementation in Rust (for fun ðŸ˜„)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on blockchain or finance projects

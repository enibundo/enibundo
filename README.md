## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate technologist with particular interest in decentralization.

Throughout my professional career I have had the chance to work in amazing teams in domains like:

- financial derivatives pricing
- trading
- arbitrage
- risk calculation and hedging
- insurance pricing
- wallet infrastructure development
- financial fund tokenization (web3)
- dapp and smart contract development
  (my full cv is found here: http://www.bun.do/cvenibundoen.pdf)

In terms of stack nowadays I mostly do typescript, node, react, nextJs, rust, solidity, terraform, aws and everything around distributed systems and microservices.
I consider myself quite flexible in terms of tech stack and like to learn continously.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about COW protocol, MEV and flashbots
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on blockchain implementation in Rust that could benefit as a learning place for new comers (pinned here below)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on blockchain or finance projects

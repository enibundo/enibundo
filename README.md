## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate technologist with particular interest in _decentralization and distributed systems_.

Throughout my professional career I have had the chance to work in amazing teams in domains like: financial derivatives pricing, trading, arbitrage, risk calculation, hedging, insurance pricing, wallet infrastructure development, financial fund tokenization (web3), dapp and smart contract development, etc. (my full cv is found here: https://www.bun.do/cvenibundoen.pdf)

In terms of stack nowadays I mostly do _kotlin, typescript, node, react, nextJs, rust, solidity, terraform, aws_ and usually work in a _distributed architecture_ using _microservices and messaging brokers_ (and recently _temporal_).
I consider myself quite flexible in terms of tech stack and like to learn continously.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about COW protocol, Solvers, MEV and flashbots
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on blockchain implementation in Rust (for funs ðŸ˜„)
- ðŸ‘¯ I am a blockchain engineer at allunity.com
